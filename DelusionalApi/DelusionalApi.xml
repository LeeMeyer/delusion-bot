             Gets delusional text connecting the passed-in word to a delusion. Even when the parameters are the same,
             response text generation involves randomness and can vary for each request.

             Sample response:
             
                 "Heat causes the desire to swim. Starting flame or fire requires heat. Starting flame or fire causes death. Death is created by homicide. Manslaughter is homicide.  I killed the invader in the bathtub. I grabbed him, and ran to the tub, strangling and suffocating him with the wires under cold water."
